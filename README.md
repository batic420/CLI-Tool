# CLI-Tool for Root-Kit

### Definition

This repo contains the code for the Root-Kit-CLI. It lets you customize and easily setup a Root-Kit Base with just a few commands.
Repo is written in Python to be lightweight and easy to add. Originally i just wanted a complete API written by myself so i can fully
understand on what base im building my future projects.

### Functionality

With root-kit you can install a typescript backend API with basic functions such as database integration or a middleware. 
Everything can be done with one single command - so no installation of npm packages or manually setting up a docker container to host the
database for it. Everything ready for you to go right at the start! Feel free to work with the code on your own and use it as the foundation
stone of your future projects - at least that what i've built it for ^^
